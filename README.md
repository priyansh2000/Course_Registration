# **Course Management System**

## **Overview**
This project is a **Course Management System** built with a **React** frontend and a **Spring Boot** backend. It provides a platform where students, administrators, and faculty can manage courses efficiently. The backend is secured using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication and role-based access control.

---

## **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend:**
- **React**: For building a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Axios**: For handling HTTP requests to the backend.
- **CSS**: For styling components and pages.

### **Backend:**
- **Spring Boot**: A Java framework used to create RESTful APIs.
- **Spring Security with JWT**: For secure authentication and role-based authorization.
- **JPA/Hibernate**: For database interaction.
- **MySQL**: The database management system for data persistence.

---

## **Features**

### **Frontend**
- **User Authentication**: Login functionality with JWT integration.
- **Course Management**: Allows users to view, enroll, and manage courses.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Based on user roles (Admin, Student).
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices.

### **Backend**
- **JWT Authentication**: Secures API endpoints.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Differentiates between administrators and students.
- **RESTful APIs**: For CRUD operations on courses, students, and enrollments.
- **Database Management**: Persistent data storage using MySQL and Hibernate.

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Frontend Setup**
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd MYAPP
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000/`.

### **Backend Setup**
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd myproject
   ```
2. Configure the `application.properties` file:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```
3. Build and run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:8080/`.

## **API Endpoints**

### **Authentication**
- **POST** `/api/auth/login`: Authenticates users and generates a JWT.

### **Courses**
- **POST** `/api/v1/courses/add`: Adds a new course.
- **GET** `/api/v1/courses/getAll`: Fetches all courses.
- **GET** `/api/v1/courses/{courseId}`: Retrieves a course by its ID.
- **PUT** `/api/v1/courses/update/{courseId}`: Updates an existing course.
- **DELETE** `/api/v1/courses/delete/{courseId}`: Deletes a course.

---

## **Security**

### **JWT Authentication Flow:**
1. **Login**: Users provide credentials to receive a JWT.
2. **Token Validation**: Secured endpoints require a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header.
3. **Role-Based Access**: Permissions are enforced based on the userâ€™s role (Admin, Student).

---

## **Usage Instructions**

1. **Admin Users**:
   - Add, update, or delete courses.
   - Manage student enrollments.
2. **Students**:
   - View available courses.
   - Enroll in courses.
   - Check enrolled courses.

## **Project Structure**

### **Frontend (React)**
- **components**: Contains React components like `Login`, `Courses`, and `Home`.
- **App.js**: Main application file for routing and layout.
- **Axios**: API communication setup.
  
### **Backend (Spring Boot)**
- **config**: Contains security configurations.
- **controller**: Defines endpoints for authentication and course management.
- **dto**: Data Transfer Objects for API payloads.
